| April 5      |            9-10pm             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 25th |         5:20 - 6:00pm         |                                                                                                                                                                                                     I tried to do this and I think I made some of the most horrendous frankenstein code I've ever seen in my life. I genuinely am embarrassed by this code and I hope nobody else sees it. It literally makes no sense and I don't think its even worth trying to explain here because I am immediately going to redo it all the next time I work on this. |
| January 26th |        12:45 - 1:45pm         | I deleted all my code from yesterday and started fresh. I had an idea to make a method that does this: takes in two coins, a small and a large coin (in relation to each other), and a target. Then, it will find the number of combinations possible for those given two coins to make the target. I thought then maybe I could use this to compare all the coins and somehow this would be dynamic programming, so far it is not working though and I don't know if the issue is with my coin comparison method or if my logic is just flawed (or both). |
| January 27th |        10:15 - 10:35pm        |        I deleted my code again and started trying to implement the idea I learned last class. It wasn't exactly a full strategy just like a kind of idea that I could split up the problem into a single method that just sees if a given coin and target combo is compatible. The I just need to change the input of the coin and target and theoretically I could get all the different combos. I tried doing this but it definitely isn't working rn so yay. Given my pretty bad understanding of the problem I don't see why this doesn't work rn tbh. |

It don't work but I tried to implement the idea we talked about in class. Maybe it's close but idk honestly. |
