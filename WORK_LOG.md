| January 25th | 5:20 - 6:00pm | I tried to do this and I think I made some of the most horrendous frankenstein code I've ever seen in my life. I genuinely am embarrassed by this code and I hope nobody else sees it. It literally makes no sense and I don't think its even worth trying to explain here because I am immediately going to redo it all the next time I work on this. |
